## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Renamed `.boxed` to `.show_background` on `WLX_Label_Opt`,
  `WLX_Checkbox_Opt`, and `WLX_Checkbox_Tex_Opt`. Removed `.boxed` from
  `WLX_Button_Opt` entirely (it was dead code — buttons always draw their
  background). Checkbox/checkbox_tex opts gain a new `full_slot_hit` field
  (default `true`) that controls whether the full slot rect is used for
  hover/click interaction, decoupling hit-testing from the visual background.
  Migration: `.boxed = true` → `.show_background = true` on labels and
  checkboxes; remove `.boxed` from button calls.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `wlx_textbox` to `wlx_label` (and `WLX_Textbox_Opt`
  to `WLX_Label_Opt`). Search-replace `wlx_textbox` → `wlx_label` in your
  code to migrate.
- **Breaking:** Interaction IDs no longer include a per-frame sequential counter.
  IDs are now `hash(file, line) ^ id_stack_hash`, matching persistent state IDs.
  Loops that emit interactive widgets MUST use `wlx_push_id()`/`wlx_pop_id()`.
- Refactored `wlx_widget()` to use `WLX_Widget_Opt` struct with designated
  initializer syntax (e.g. `wlx_widget(ctx, .color = red)`), replacing the
  old positional color argument.
- Refactored state pool from a linear array to an open-addressing hashmap for
  faster persistent state lookups.

### Added
- Optional `.id` field on all widget option structs for explicit string-based
  identity (e.g. `.id = "my_button"`). When set, the string is hashed and
  pushed onto the ID stack automatically, giving widgets stable IDs independent
  of source location.
- `wlx_hash_string()` helper — djb2 hash for string-to-ID conversion.
- `WLX_DEBUG` compile-time mode: warns when the same call-site is hit multiple
  times per frame without `wlx_push_id()`, helping catch ID collision bugs.
- SDL3_ttf font support in the SDL3 backend (`wollix_sdl3.h`).
- Widgets gallery demo (`demos/gallery.c`).
- Font demo (`demos/font_demo.c`).
- CI: Raylib and SDL3 demo builds, sanitizer tests, `-Werror` test.

### Fixed
- `active_id_seen` tracking bug where stale active IDs could persist across
  frames when the originating widget was removed.
